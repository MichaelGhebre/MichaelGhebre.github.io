title: Variable Selection in Model-based Clustering
---

We proposed a new method to select variables for model-based clustering (Gaussian mixture model optimized using the EM-algorithm). The optimal numbers of clusters are identified using BIC (Bayesian information criterion), in which the smaller is the better. Here, I will show if selecting clustering relevant variables will improve the identification of the optimal number of clusters using real and simulated datasets in R.
