title: Variable Selection in Model-based Clustering!
---

We propose a new method to select variables for model-based clustering (Gausssian mixure model optimazed using the EM-algrorithm). The oprimal clusters were identified using BIC (Baysian information criterio) in which the smaller is the better. Here, I will show if selecting a clustering relevant variables will improve identifying the optimal clusters using real and simulated datasets.
