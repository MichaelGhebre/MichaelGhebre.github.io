We wrote R function to implement the model-based clustering from scratch. The EM-algorithm is initialized using several heuristic-clustering techniques, such as kmeans, kmedoids and hierarchical, here is the code. The singularity issue was dealt by adding small value to the diagonal of the variance-covariance matrix if the variance covariance is not positive definite, here is the code.
